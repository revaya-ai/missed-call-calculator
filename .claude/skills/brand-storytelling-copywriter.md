# Brand Storytelling Copywriter

## Overview
Strategic brand copywriting that converts browsers into buyers through story-driven messaging. Focused on small business brands that need to differentiate in crowded markets.

**Core Principle:** Every brand story requires a hurdle. Without conflict, you have a timeline, not a story. Without a story, you have no emotional engagement. Without emotional engagement, you have no conversion.

## When to Use This Skill
- Brand messaging development (About pages, founder stories, mission statements)
- Website copy that needs emotional resonance + conversion focus
- Product descriptions that sell benefits through story
- Email sequences building customer relationships
- Social content that builds brand authority
- Any copy where "why we exist" matters as much as "what we sell"

## Core Frameworks

### The Hurdle Principle

**Every brand story needs 5 elements:**

1. **Desire** - What the customer wants (goal state)
2. **Obstacle** - What blocks them (the hurdle)
3. **Stakes** - What happens if they fail (consequence)
4. **Guide** - How your brand helps (solution)
5. **Transformation** - What changes after overcoming (result)

**Without the obstacle, you have no story.**

### StoryBrand Framework (Donald Miller)

```
1. Customer wants something (desire)
2. Problem blocks them (HURDLE - external, internal, philosophical)
3. Brand appears as guide (not hero)
4. Provides a plan (path over hurdle)
5. Calls to action (decision point)
6. Success looks like this (transformation)
7. Failure looks like this (stakes)
```

**The hurdle has three levels:**
- **External:** Tangible obstacle (broken HVAC, no leads, bad website)
- **Internal:** How it makes them feel (frustrated, overwhelmed, embarrassed)
- **Philosophical:** Why it's wrong (small businesses deserve better)

### Jobs-to-be-Done (Clayton Christensen)

**Customer hiring your product to:**
- Functional job (what task needs doing)
- Emotional job (how they want to feel)
- Social job (how they want to be perceived)

**Application:** Copy speaks to the job, not just features. The hurdle is what prevents them from completing the job.

### Brand Archetypes

**12 Archetypes:**
- **Hero** (Nike) - triumph over adversity
- **Outlaw** (Harley-Davidson) - break the rules
- **Magician** (Apple) - transform reality
- **Lover** (Chanel) - intimacy and passion
- **Jester** (Old Spice) - live in the moment
- **Everyman** (IKEA) - belonging and connection
- **Caregiver** (Johnson & Johnson) - service and compassion
- **Ruler** (Mercedes) - control and power
- **Creator** (Lego) - innovation and expression
- **Innocent** (Dove) - purity and optimism
- **Sage** (Google) - knowledge and wisdom
- **Explorer** (Patagonia) - freedom and discovery

## Story Structure Template

### Hurdle-First Framework

**Structure:**
```
1. Desire (what customer wants)
2. Hurdle (specific obstacle blocking them)
3. Failed attempts (what they've already tried)
4. Stakes (cost of not solving this)
5. Guide (your brand's unique approach)
6. Plan (how you help them over the hurdle)
7. Success (life after the hurdle)
```

### Example: HVAC Company

**Before (No Hurdle):**
> "We provide HVAC service. We're reliable. Call us."

**After (With Hurdle):**
> "Your furnace dies at 11 PM in January. Kids are cold. You call three companies.
> 
> The hurdle: Nobody answers. Or they quote you triple for emergency rates. Or they can't come until Thursday.
> 
> You're stuck choosing between getting ripped off tonight or freezing until Thursday.
> 
> We answer. We come. We charge the same flat rate we always do. Because HVAC emergencies shouldn't punish you for bad timing."

### Example: Revaya AI

**Before (No Hurdle):**
> "We build AI voice agents for small businesses. Automate your calls and reclaim time."

**After (With Hurdle):**
> "You started your business to build something, not to answer the same questions 40 times a week.
> 
> The hurdle: But if you don't answer, you lose leads. If you hire someone, you lose margin. If you ignore it, you burn out.
> 
> You're trapped working IN the business when you should be working ON it.
> 
> Our AI voice agents handle the repetitive conversations so you can focus on what actually grows your company. Reclaim 15-20 hours a week without sacrificing revenue."

## Copywriting Patterns

### Before/After/Bridge (BAB)
- Before: Customer's current painful state (with specific hurdle)
- After: Desired future state (hurdle overcome)
- Bridge: Your solution as the path between them

### Problem/Agitate/Solve (PAS)
- Problem: Identify the pain point (the hurdle)
- Agitate: Amplify the consequences (the stakes)
- Solve: Position your solution (the guide)

### Feature/Advantage/Benefit (FAB)
- Feature: What it is (technical spec)
- Advantage: What it does (capability)
- Benefit: What it means (emotional payoff)

## Writing Rules

### DO:
- Lead with transformation, not transaction
- Use sensory details (show, don't tell)
- Write to one person, not "customers"
- Make the customer the hero, brand the guide
- Use specific numbers over vague claims
- Identify the hurdle before writing any copy
- Define clear stakes
- End sections with clear next steps
- Cut ruthlessly

### DON'T:
- Start with company history
- Use jargon unless audience demands it
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Bury the value proposition below the fold
- Write features without connecting to benefits
- Use passive voice
- Skip the hurdle
- Ignore the stakes

### Banned Words:
Leverage, synergy, robust, comprehensive, cutting-edge, game-changing, world-class, innovative (unless proven), solutions (overused), ecosystem, next-generation, revolutionary, disruptive, utilize (use "use")

## Conversion Structure

### Homepage Hero:
- Headline: Clear promise (transformation after overcoming hurdle)
- Subheadline: The specific hurdle + who it's for
- CTA Button: Action-oriented verb
- Trust Signal: Social proof, stat, or credential

### About Page:
1. Origin Story: Why you started (your hurdle)
2. Mission: What you're fighting for
3. Values: How you operate differently
4. Social Proof: Results delivered
5. CTA: Next step

### Product/Service Page:
1. Desire: What customer wants
2. Hurdle: Specific obstacle
3. Stakes: Cost of inaction
4. Your Solution: How you help
5. How It Works: 3-step process
6. Benefits: Transformation outcomes
7. Social Proof: Testimonials
8. CTA: Clear next action

## Research Process

2. How do you make money?
3. Who is your ideal customer?
4. What makes you different?

**Hurdle Identification:**

6. What have they already tried? Why didn't it work?

8. What's the internal frustration this creates?
9. Why is it wrong that this problem exists?

**Brand Voice:**
10. Why did you start this business?
11. What do customers say about you?
12. What do you never want to sound like?
13. If your brand was a person, who would they be?

**Goals:**
14. What are you trying to achieve?
15. Any constraints or guidelines?
16. Timeline and budget?

### Customer Research:
1. Review testimonials for patterns
2. Analyze competitor messaging
3. Interview 3-5 actual customers
4. Mine review sites and forums
